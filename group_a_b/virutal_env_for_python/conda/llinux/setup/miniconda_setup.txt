## Installing Miniconda on Linux(Ubuntu):

    1. For viewing the Miniconda installer:

        Official site link to download miniconda installer:
        ==> https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#linux-installers

        Select the latest version miniconda for your OS, and right click on that link & copy the link address
    

    2. To download the installer:
        ==> Open your terminal

        run the command:
            ==> wget copied_link_address
            eg: ==> wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
            press "Enter"

        NOTE: Miniconda installer file is downloaded in Home directory


    3. To install the downloaded installer, run the following command:
        ==> sh Miniconda-latest-Linux-version.sh
        eg: ==> sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
        press "Enter"


    4. Follow the prompts on the installer screens:

        If you are unsure about any setting, accept the defaults. You can change them later.

        Steps:
        1. press "Enter" to read license aggreement
        2. Then, press 'q' if u don't want to read all of that
        3. Then, type "yes" and press "Enter", to accept the license term

        Now, a message will be prompted on screen saying:
            "Miniconda3 will now be installed into this location:
            /home/username/miniconda3"

            press "Enter"
    

        Now, a message will be prompted on screen saying:
            "Do you wish the installer to initialize Miniconda3
            by running conda init? [yes|no]"

            ==> type "yes" and press "Enter"



    6. To verify conda installation:
        SYNTAX ==> source /home/username/.bashrc
        eg: ==> source /home/dhiraj/.bashrc

        press "Enter"


        Hopefully, if everything has gone well, then u will be on conda (base) environment on terminal


        NOTE: u can go outside of conda (base) environment by using command:
            ==> conda deactivate

        NOTE: u can be inside conda(base) environment by using command:
